            Welcome to <span className="font-semibold">Riding On The Verge</span> â€“ where
            the journey is as epic as the destination!
            <br />
            <br />
            From the scorching dunes of Rajasthan&apos;s deserts to the snow-kissed peaks of
            the Himalayas, from lush green valleys to wild national parks and mighty rivers &ndash;
            we ride through every heartbeat of India.
            <br />
            <br />
            Our adventures are more than just rides &mdash; they are raw, real, and unfiltered experiences
            on the back of our roaring Harley-Davidson bikes. Every trail has a story, every mountain
            hides a memory, and every river sings a new song.
            <br />
            <br />
            Whether it&apos;s the spiritual serenity of the hills, the roaring rush of the highways, or
            the untouched beauty of nature, we capture it all &mdash; the thrill, the challenges, and the
            breathtaking views &mdash; so you can experience the freedom of the road with us.
            <br />
            <br />
            Subscribe, buckle up, and let&apos;s ride through the soul of India together &mdash; one destination,
            one emotion, one throttle at a time.
